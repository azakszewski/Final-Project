# Final-Project
for this project I wanted to look at a dataset from IMDB, which is a movie rating company, it has many variables in the dataset like the rating, votes, metascore, revenue, etc. I wanted to see if all the variables in this dataset would help predict the outcome of the rating. 
# Cleaning
While cleaning the data my main goal was to clean up null values and for the actors and directores category, turn that into numerical values to allow me to use linear regression and KNN. I also narrowed it down to the top 10 genres and from there, grouped the data based off the first genre that was listed for the movie. The main listed actors were also grouped numerically, and they are pretty much unique to each entry. Along with this I wanted to get the mean of the metascore and standardize that for the data as well. Lastly I cleaned up null values in certain spots. The data was pretty clean to begin with, so it was more converting it to a numerical value to be used. I also dropped the movie title and description, as those wouldn't be needed for the final data
# Machine Learning 
For the data I chose to use multilinear regression and KNN. Based on my hypothesis I wanted to look at all the variables and how they impacted the rating, so I included them in the model. Based off the results the R^2 value was not the greatest and it showed that these variables alone didn't have the greatest impact on rating. Another thing that I found interesting after messing with the data, is that actually by using the votes as the predicted value, it gave a way better R^2 and seemed to fit the line better. Attached is my main file using the main hypothesis and then I also included an extra file where I do use votes at the predicted value, just to see the difference. For KNN I needed to bin the data seeing as it was continous, which puts the data in groups based of the rating. From there I was able to use KNN, the problem is the bins were the most evenly distributed as many rating fell in the same categeory, but for the cateogry that did have a lot of values, it was able to predict it pretty well.
# Overall Result
The overall result of my main hypothesis wasn't the greatest, but it did show that there are a lot more factors that come into play when it comes to the rating of a movie.
